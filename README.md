# Numeric System Converter
This very simple web application allows users to input numbers in any of the following numeric systems: decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal. The application then automatically converts the input into all the other systems, providing a quick and easy way to work across these bases.

## Features
* Real-time conversion: as you type in any field, the values in the other numeric systems are instantly updated.
* Input validation: ensures that only valid characters are allowed based on the selected numeric system (e.g., only 0 and 1 for binary).
* Automatic corrections: removes invalid leading zeros and ensures consistent formatting.
* Modular design: the code is structured to handle extensions and improvements easily.
## Upcoming Updates
* Screenshots and Video Demos: I'll update this README with visuals showing the application in action.
* Modal Windows: Currently, Iâ€™m developing modal popups (for now, there's only one with temporary styling) that provide an introduction to each numeric system and explain where and how they're commonly used.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements!

## Usage
